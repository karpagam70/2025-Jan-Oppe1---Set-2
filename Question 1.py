Check If a number divides two other numbers
Write a function is_both_divisible_by that takes three integers a, b and c as input and checks if a and b numbers are divisible by c. Assume that c number is non-zero.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

>>>is_both_divisible_by(10, 15, 5) # both 10 and 15 are divisible by 5
True
>>>is_both_divisible_by(10, 13, 5) # 13 is not divisible by 5
False
>>>is_both_divisible_by(19, 15, 5) # 19 is not divisible by 5
False
