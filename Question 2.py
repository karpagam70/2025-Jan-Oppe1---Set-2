Check String Rotation
Write a function that checks if one string is a rotation of another.

Hint: all the rotations of a particular string will be present in the string formed by concatenating it with itself.

For example the rotations of the word apple can be formed by.

a[pplea]pple - pplea
ap[pleap]ple - pleap
app[leapp]le - leapp
appl[eappl]e - eappl
apple[apple] - apple
NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

>>>is_rotation('abcde','cdeab')
True
>>>is_rotation('hello','ehllo')
False
>>>is_rotation('hello','helol')
False
Explanation

Since cdeab is a rotation of abcde,
So, is_rotation('abcde','cdeab') should return True
