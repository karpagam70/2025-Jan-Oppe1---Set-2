Pattern Printing - Z Pattern
You are tasked with drawing a Z-shaped pattern using asterisks (*). The Z pattern is a right-angled triangle with horizontal lines at the top and bottom, and a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left.

Note that there should be no space after the last '*' in a line.

Input Format

A single integer n representing the size of the Z pattern (i.e., the number of rows and columns). It is guaranteed that n >= 3.
Output Format

Print the Z pattern with n rows, each containing n characters (either a * or a space). The pattern should be drawn with:
A row of asterisks at the top.
A diagonal line of asterisks from the top-right to the bottom-left.
A row of asterisks at the bottom.
