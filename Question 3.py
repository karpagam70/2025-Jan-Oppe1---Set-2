Find missing number in a range of numbers
Given a list with numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) except one number in the range, write a function to find the missing number.

Assume that only one number from the range will be missing in the given list.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

Given the inputs nums=[1, 4, 2, 4, 6, 5, 6] and n is 6.

The number 3 is missing from the range. So, find_missing_number(nums) should return 3 as it is the missing number.
